DISCLAIMER

The Apache NiFi 1.x release line can no longer be reliably updated
due to changes in the support life cycle of critical components
the NiFi 1.x line is tied to.

These no longer maintainable components include Java itself, Spring Framework,
Jetty, and many other smaller but important libraries which have moved to
newer JDK versions and have reached end of life or end of support for the
dependencies we rely on.  The UI and front-end code is also built on very
legacy frameworks and is not maintainable as-is from a vulnerability
point of view.

All users are encouraged to migrate to Apache NiFi 2.x where all of these
key dependencies have been upgraded or completely rewritten to their latest
forms and we are able to effectively address such reports or findings.
